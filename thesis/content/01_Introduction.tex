How big is big? 
Hundreds of thousands of years are already necessary for light to traverse our Galaxy, comprising hundreds of billions of stars.
The Universe is even bigger with 2 trillion of similar galaxies accessible to our observations.
The size of the observable universe has been determined by the Planck space mission to be 13.8 billion light years, deduced from the most precise map of the cosmic microwave background to date.
This is already vastly big, but the Universe beyond the observable one is once again by a multitude bigger.
Arthur Dent -- the main character in \textit{The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy} -- must have felt rather lost in this mind-bogglingly big space.
