# Jupyter Notebooks

The examples in this folder are so-called ipython notebooks (.ipynb). They can be viewed here, but you can also download them and use them intereactively.

During the school, we will also work with these notebooks, since they are very useful for developing code and learning new tools.

#### Start a Notebook

* Where necessary, activate a specific conda environment, e.g. for the school: `source activate cta-oz`
* Start a specific notebook via `jupyter notebook SomeNotebook.ipynb`
* You can create a new notebook via `File->New->Notebook` and select python 3 or `New->Python 3`.

#### Execute Code

Just type `Shift+Enter` to execute a cell.

#### Help

To get information on an object, method, ... (within a notebook): Type the name followed by a question mark and then `Enter`.
For example:
`numpy.percentile?`
