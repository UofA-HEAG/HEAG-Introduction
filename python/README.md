# Jupyter Notebooks

The examples in this folder are so-called ipython notebooks (.ipynb). They can be viewed here, but you can also download them and use them intereactively.  
They are very useful for developing code and learning new tools.
_(Add comment to the use of scripts.)_

#### Start a Notebook

* Where necessary, activate a specific conda environment, for example: `source activate my_environment`
* Start a specific notebook via `jupyter notebook SomeNotebook.ipynb`
* You can create a new notebook via `File->New->Notebook` and select python 3 or `New->Python 3`.

#### Execute Code

Just type `Shift+Enter` to execute a cell.

#### Help

To get information on an object, method, ... (within a notebook): Type the name followed by a question mark and then `Enter`.
For example:
`numpy.percentile?`
