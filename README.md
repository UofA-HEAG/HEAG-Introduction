# Introduction for HEAG Students

This repository is supposed to support new (and also current) students set up their computers and provide introductions to common software and tools.


## Introduction to HEAG Subjects

__Wiki account__: On our wiki (http://www.physics.adelaide.edu.au/astrophysics/wiki) page you can find information on our different meetings, slides from our meetings, the current seminar schedule etc.  
Please contact Sabrina for an account.

__HEAG email list__: This list is used to provide information about upcoming HEAG meetings.  
Please contact Bruce.

__Physics account__: You will need this account to be able to login to other computers in our network. The machine `bragg` is commonly used as a gateway, providing access from outside as well.  
Please contact your supervisor for an account.

__HEAG seminar__: 
The High Energy Astrophysics Group meets weekly (currenty each Tuesday 11.10am) in order to discuss group members' work and new results of interest in the field of high-energy astrophysics. 
An email will be sent out each week on the day of the meeting as a reminder.
Generally, these meetings involve one person giving a ~25 minute talk about their research, followed by someone else pointing out interesting papers released on astro-ph in the last week. 
The contributions for these presentations are shared amongst the members of the group, and are assigned by a dedicated tool.
Currently, the group meetings are co-ordinated by Sabrina. 
A record of the meetings is kept on the wiki page, along with the slides from that week's talk if available.
You can access the Abstracts of Interest Page (where each week's abstracts are listed) here: http://www.physics.adelaide.edu.au/astrophysics/Abstracts/new_abs.html  
If you are a master or PhD student, please contact Sabrina.
